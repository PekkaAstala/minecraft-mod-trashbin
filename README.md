# Minecraft 1.14 Mod / Trash Bin

> My first attempt at creating Minecraft mods. That is something I've been planning to do get into for a good while but didn't seem to find time for until the summer of 2019. This is mostly a learning excercise but it works and it touches many of the major areas of minecraft modding: Creating custom blocks, textures, crafting recipes and interaction with custom UIs.

> At the time of writing this the Minecraft 1.14 is still quite new and Forge (the community created modding kit) documentation for it is **very** incomplete so getting things to work was a lot of trial and error and piecing things together from various sources. I'm planning to write tutorial of the process if I find time to do it while it would still be relevant.

In vanilla minecraft there is no convenient way to get rid of unwanted blocks: You can throw them to the ground (and often accidentally pick them up again before they despawn) or you can pour some lava somewhere, throw unwanted items to it and also risk walking to it by yourself.

Mod Trash Bin simply adds a new craftable custom block: The Trash Bin. Interacting with the block allows you to instantly delete items.
